      <h2>About Me!</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my site! A fullstack software engineer by training, I enjoy developing websites with top-notch 
        user experiences and lightning fast responsiveness. My approach to web development is to put myself in the shoes
        of the user and ask,"What about this web page is irksome, and how would I make it better?".  
      </p>
      <p>My burgeoning coding skills are reaching super human levels! I love exploring frontend frameworks including
        React, Backbone, and AngularJS - with React being my current obsession. For the backend, I am proficient in NodeJs,
        Express, and various SQL and noSQL databases. 
      </p>
      <p>The creative energies I have must be unleashed! I can't imagine a better way to do that than to devote myself to building
        flexible, harmonized web interfaces accompanied with an optimized server-side architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, you can find me exploring the Bay Area, letting out my inner foodie at a local restaurant, chugging loads of coffee, 
        or reading up on the latest news in tech and politics. I'm always open to meeting new people - feel free to shoot me an email anytime!
